# NHYAML
A markup language that uses the yaml syntax for building tiny and simple things keeping everything easy, from grids to centering divs

## Implementations
I already implemented this in python just foor getting things ready fast, but a new implementation in Go, for more speed, is comming.

## How to use this?
Look at the [docs](docs/docs.md)

## Why to use this?
I am inspired on picocss to this. Technically, I wanted to do something like that but with grid support. I wasn't so excited about doing just a framework so I've made a markup language. I also didn't want tto reinvent a new syntax parse so I just used yaml. This is good 'cause you can just get things not that bad so easier than normally.

## Installation

Run

    git clone github.com/MarkChase3/NHYAML
    pip install pyyaml
    cd NHYAML
    python NHYAML.py
